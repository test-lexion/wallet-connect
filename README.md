InvestreWallet is built with a focus on performance, security, and a superior developer experience.

*   **Frontend:** The application is developed using **React 19** with **TypeScript**, taking advantage of the latest features and performance enhancements offered by the newest version of the popular library.
*   **Build Tool:** **Vite** serves as the build tool, providing a significantly faster and more streamlined development experience. Known for its instant server startup and optimized production builds, Vite is a next-generation tool for modern web projects.
*   **Wallet Integration:** **Reown (formerly WalletConnect)** is utilized for its powerful toolkits that allow for seamless and secure integration of web3-native features.
*   **Code Quality:** **ESLint** is configured with TypeScript support to ensure the codebase is clean, consistent, and free of errors through static code analysis.
